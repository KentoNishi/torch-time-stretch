Welcome to the `torch-time-stretch` documentation!

## What is `torch-time-stretch`?

*Time-stretch audio clips quickly with PyTorch (CUDA supported)! Additional utilities for searching efficient transformations are included.*

This package includes two main features:

* Time-stretch audio clips quickly using PyTorch (with CUDA support)
* Calculate efficient time-stretch targets (useful for augmentation, where speed is more important than precise time-stretches)
