## About

This package includes two main features:
* Time-stretch audio clips quickly using PyTorch (with CUDA support)
* Calculate efficient time-stretch targets (useful for augmentation, where speed is more important than precise time-stretches)

## Installation
```bash
pip install torch-time-stretch
```

## Usage
